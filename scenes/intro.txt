On a cold Halloween night you decide to go trick or treating 
with your friends. However, one of the neighbours laces the candy
with Triazolam, a powerful central nervous system depressant tranquilizer.

You wake up in the basement of an abandoned mansion and you have no
recollection of what happened.

In front of you are three doors. Each door hides a different kind of 
horrific monster or death trap, but while opening two of the doors will kill
you in a gruesome way, opening the third door won't be lethal.

Can you find which door to open and escape the mansion?
