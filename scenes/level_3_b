You chose door B which is the wrong door. 

Alligators can survive 2 years without food. Their metabolism is so 
evolved that their body uses and stores nearly the entirety of 
the food it consumes. This is one reason why larger crocodiles 
can go for over a year without eating a meal. In extreme situations, 
crocodiles appear to be able to shut down and live off their 
own tissue for a long period of time.
